## Steps to get the app working

 [ x ] Step 1. On android end, create auth and validate it
Step 2. Integrate instagram api
Step 3. Integrate the internal API
Step 4. pick a database provider and host it on a free cloud
Step 5. Create an API to get and write to this database 
Step 6. Test most famous people in my list
        A. Create Socials, Instagram, twitter and Snapchat, TikTok
Step 7. Create an story share feature to instagram stories crediting the app
Step 8. Create an invite system to invite freinds to the app via text and instagram

## Second Try,
create an app that gets the users contacts
checks phone numbers aganist the db to see if they're in them
if not it tells the user that you friends arent on the app yet, invite them to the app
if users exist it does the six degrees of separation thing
